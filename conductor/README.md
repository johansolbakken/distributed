# Conductor plan

### 1. **Data Node Management**
- **Create**: To register a new service or node in the system. This operation can also involve specifying ephemeral nodes that disappear when the node disconnects, which is useful for tracking which processes are currently alive.
- **Delete**: To remove a service or node from the system, either manually or automatically (in the case of ephemeral nodes).

### 2. **Data Management**
- **Read**: To retrieve information about a node or service, such as its metadata, state, or configuration details.
- **Update**: To change the data or state of a node or service. This might include changing configuration settings or updating the status of a service.

### 3. **Watchers**
- **Set Watcher**: To set a watch on a node. A watcher is a callback that gets triggered in response to specified events, such as a change in the node's data or the creation/deletion of a node. This is crucial for processes to react promptly to changes in the distributed system.

### 4. **Synchronization**
- **Locks**: Implement distributed locks to manage access to shared resources across your distributed system. This helps in synchronizing operations and preventing race conditions.
- **Barriers**: Enable coordinated actions, such as ensuring that a group of nodes reaches a certain state before proceeding with an operation.

### 5. **Membership and Group Services**
- **List Members**: To list all the current members (nodes or services) within a specified group. This is essential for understanding the current makeup of the system.
- **Leader Election**: Facilitate automatic leader election among a group of nodes, which is important for scenarios where a single coordinator or leader is needed to make decisions or manage tasks.

### 6. **Fault Tolerance**
- **Session Management**: Handle sessions for clients connected to your service, including session expiration and reconnection strategies.
- **Data Replication**: Ensure data is replicated across different nodes or servers to enhance availability and fault tolerance.

### 7. **Configuration Management**
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow dynamic updates to configuration without needing to restart services or nodes. This involves notifying affected nodes about the changes.

### 8. **Health Checks and Monitoring**
- **Node Health Check**: Implement mechanisms to monitor the health and performance of nodes, including heartbeat or ping mechanisms to detect failures.

### 9. **Security**
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure your system by ensuring that only authenticated clients can access or modify the managed services or nodes.
